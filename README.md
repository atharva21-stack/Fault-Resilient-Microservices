## Introduction
Monolithic solutions where a single point of failure can derail an operation present significant engineering challenges, especially in systems requiring high availability. This difficulty can be addressed through Microservices architecture, which ensures processes are independent, responsibilities are decentralized, and problems are isolated.

Despite the robustness of microservices, they are not inherently fault resilient. This project focuses on enhancing fault tolerance through the strategic implementation of resilience patterns within a microservice architecture.

## Goals
- Enhance system availability and manage failures proactively.
- Implement resilience patterns as the core of microservice architecture.
- Address service interdependencies and mitigate cascading failures.

## Resilience in Microservices
Understanding that no solution is perfect, this project emphasizes readiness for any failure scenario:
- How should Service B respond if it only receives partial data from Service C?
- What fallback mechanisms should be in place if a service fails?
- How do we ensure continuity of service despite individual component failures?

This readiness is achieved through detailed scenario analysis, rigorous testing, and the application of resilience patterns before production deployment.

## Patterns of Resilience

### Scenario Identification
Before deploying to production, we conduct integration, performance, unit, and architectural tests to ensure functionality and quality. However, identifying potential failure scenarios and designing appropriate mitigation strategies is crucial.

### Chaos Engineering
We introduce Chaos Engineering to simulate and manage crises, testing how the architecture withstands various failure scenarios like:
- Service A's communication failures.
- Database downtimes.
- Server disconnections.

### Mitigating Cascading Failures
We address inter-service dependencies to prevent cascading errors. This includes ensuring services are designed to recover automatically from failures, thereby maintaining the overall system's resilience.

### Mitigating Single Points of Failure
From the design phase, we focus on eliminating single points of failure to ensure the robustness of the entire ecosystem.

## Implementing Resilience Patterns
We implement and illustrate the main resilience patterns through a conceptual approach supported by examples on GitHub:
